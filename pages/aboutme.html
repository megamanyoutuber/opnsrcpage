            Oh, well hello there. If you came here, you may or may not know me, or if you do, you only briefly know me and want to learn more about me in general. You may know me for a lot of things, such as my YouTube videos or my presence on whatever Discord server you are on.
        </p>

            My name is Sonja, online usually known as ivyflow3r (pronounced as ivy flower). I have used other usernames before but I am currently only under this alias, so please to refer me as either Sonja or ivyflow3r, thank you.

            My primary interests are old tech, Mega Man, Nine Inch Nails, Radiohead and etc. You may know that already though considering how often I talk about stuff that I like, especially on servers that I am active on.
